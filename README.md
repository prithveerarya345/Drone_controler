# Drone_controler
A drone control system with face detection and tracking


## Project Overview

Drone_controller is a Python-based project that explores the fascinating world of drone programming using the DJI Tello drone. This project represents a significant learning journey, diving into real-time control systems, computer vision, and autonomous flight.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained invaluable experience in:

- Real-time drone control using Python
- Implementation of computer vision techniques for face tracking
- Development of a custom mapping system for drone movement
- Integration of keyboard controls for intuitive drone piloting
- Practical understanding of drone photography and video streaming

## Features

- **Basic Controls**: Intuitive keyboard-based control system for the Tello drone.
- **Face Tracking**: Autonomous face detection and tracking capabilities.
- **Mapping**: Real-time 2D mapping of the drone's movement.
- **Photo Capture**: On-demand photo capture during flight.

## Credits
This project is based on the tutorial by Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI on YouTube.
